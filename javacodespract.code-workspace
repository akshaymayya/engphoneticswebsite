/*/*Sure! Here's a normal, simple explanation of what your code does:

---

 What is this code?

This is a basic HTML web page for learning English phonetics. When you open this page in a browser, it shows:

* A big welcome message
* A short description
* Three buttons (links) that take you to different parts of the learning site



### What are the parts?

1. **HTML structure**
   The page is written using HTML. It has two main parts:

   * `<head>`: Sets up the title and the styles (how the page looks)
   * `<body>`: Holds the content that the user sees (text and buttons)

2. **CSS styling**
   Inside the `<style>` tag, there is CSS that:

   * Gives the page a colorful background
   * Centers everything on the screen
   * Styles the buttons (color, padding, hover effect)

3. **Page content**

   * The `<h1>` tag shows the title: **"Welcome to English Phonetics Learning"**
   * The `<p>` tag gives a short instruction
   * There are **three buttons** (`<a>` tags styled as buttons) that link to:

     * A phonetic symbols guide
     * A quiz app
     * A flashcard app       */

/*What happens when someone uses it?

* They see a nice background with centered text.
* They read the welcome message.
* They click a button to go to a different learning tool.

Would you like me to explain what each line of code does?

Sure! explanation of project workspace configuration code:

---

This code is a **VS Code workspace configuration** file for your **English Phonetics Learning project**. It helps you manage multiple parts of your project in one place by adding different folders to the workspace. These folders include:

1. The main project folder (represented by `"."`)
2. The **Phonetics** section
3. The **Quiz App**
4. The **Flashcard App**

By including these folders, VS Code lets you switch between them easily and work on all parts of your project together.

The `"settings"` part of the code is used to configure **Live Server**, a popular VS Code extension that lets you preview web pages in your browser. It sets a name for your multi-folder project in Live Server as **"javacodespract"**, so you can run and test any part of your project directly in the browser without needing to open each folder separately.

This setup is very helpful for organizing your full project in one workspace and improving your development workflow.##*/
